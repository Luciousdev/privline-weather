#Privline Weather

This is the main source code of the PrivLine Weather website.


1st note: I made this using a tutorial, I will be modifying it more in the future (I did already not follow everything from the video).

2nd note:  This website is also build into the normal website. This was made to experiment with some things, it will be kept up but most likely not updated. So if something breaks it most likely won't be fixed, unless we feel like it and have a lot of time free.
